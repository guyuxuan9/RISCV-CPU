## Contributions
For the basic non-pipelined CPU, I implemented the specifications for Register File, ALU and the related MUX, and sign-extend.

When the basic non-pipelined CPU is completed, I implemented the machine code for the F1 program, and Yuxuan and I tested the program on GTK wave.

For the pipelined CPU, I implemented the registers and control units individual components. 
During the process, I carried out test cases to ensure that instructions such as addi and jal work as the pipelined CPU is in the progress.


## Reflections



## Mistakes
Initially, I did not understand the meaning behind commit messages and placed the date/time when i commit as the commit message. However, after a week, I realised that commit messages are meant for the team to comprehend the progress of the coursework and hence I placed purposeful commit messages after that.
