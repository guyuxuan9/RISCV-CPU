- This program should have 3 misses in the first cycle and contents in the main memory is then written into cache
- When **lw** is executed again, hit should be 1
- This is exactly what is shown in the waveform

- In the first loop, as before, there is nothing in cache, so 3 **lw** instructions result in 3 misses.
- After 3 cycles delay (Fetch,Decode,Execute), cache is updated in the 4th stage (Memory). Note that the update happens at the second half of the 4th stage, because it is specified in **cachemem.sv** that **ram_array** will be written in the **negative clock edge**

- Second loop cycle

- **Hit** is 1 this time. Since all the pipelined registers are written in the negative edge of the clock cycle, after 3 negative clock edges (Fetch->Decode, Decode->Execute, Execute->Memory), **hit** will be 1
